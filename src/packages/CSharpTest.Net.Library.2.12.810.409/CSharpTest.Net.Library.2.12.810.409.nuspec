    <description>==CSharpTest.Net.Library==
A collection of unrelated helper classes and utilities for a wide variety of
uses:

- Base classes like Disposable, Comparable, Equatable
- Configuration based UserSettings
- Object cloning and deep cloning
- Disposable lists
- OrdinalList / set operations on bits
- SetList / set operations on small lists
- Parsing command-line arguments
- Complete command-line interpreter
- BinaryComparer and ReferenceComparer implementations
- Cryptography AES Rijndael RSA Process PBKDF2 Hash Salt Password PasswordKey 
  SaltedData SecureString Whirlpool HashStream Secure Transfer over PKI
- Thread safe EventHandler for WinForms
- Base64Stream ByteEncoding HexEncoding HexStream Safe64Encoding Safe64Stream
- Xml and Html Parser and DOM tree with XSLT/XPath support
- Missing interfaces like IClonable&lt;T&gt; IFactory&lt;T&gt; and ITransactable
- IO Stream utilities Aggregate stream base, ClampedStream, CombinedStream
  DisposingStream NonClosingStream CopyStream MarshallingStream StreamCache
- TempDirectory and TempFile to manage temporary file resources
- FragmentedFile storing multiple streams of data in a single file
- IpcChannel for fully connected cross process event broadcasting
- ProcessRunner and AssemblyRunner to run command-line and capture output
- ScriptRunner to run a variety of common script types and capture output
- Property and nested property value serializer via reflection
- Binary and Text serializaiton for most common .NET types
- ArgumentList for parsing command-line switch arguments
- FileList a collection of FileInfo's
- ILockStrategy and ILockFactory to abstract reader/writer locking
- SimpleReadWriteLocking based on Monitor.Enter (faster than the two built
  in Reader/Writer locks)
- Lock diagnostics and statistics like debug locking, counter locking
- MutexLock a Disposable wrapper for a Mutex
- SafeLock a Disposable wrapper for Monitor.Enter
- WorkQueue for Action and Action&lt;T&gt; delegates
- WaitAndContinue single-thread work list based on wait handles
- ObjectKeepAlive to keep a limited reference list to WeakReferences
- WeakReference&lt;T&gt; a strongly typed derivation of WeakReferences
- RegexPatterns a list of commonly used patterns</description>
